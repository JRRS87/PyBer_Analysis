# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview


The purpose of this project was to vizualize, and analyze the performance and trends of a rideshare company named PyBer. It tracks the total fares of 3 different city types over the first half of 2019. We will use the results we visualize to present and make recommendations to the CEO.

## Results


The dataframe  that has been created, it does give us data to draw conclusions. We are able to determine that Urban cities generate the most rides and total fares by a considerable amount. Suburban is the next highest in those categories followed by Rural cities. Urban areas also have the most drivers followed by the Suburban cities then the Rural cities. The urban cities are also so heavily saturated by drivers, the average fare per ride and fare per driver are much lower than the other 2 categories.


By referencing the below line plot, we are also able to determine the total fares never intersect. The urban cities are always the highest grossing, followed by suburban, then rural. Each city type does have an overall positive growth which shows the company is growing, and there is a high volume spike towards the end of February for each city type.


## Summary


Using Pyber data analysis, it's possible to recomend some actions that can be taken to address disparities between city types.

Increase the number of drivers in Rural cities to meet the demand, as we have 125 rides for 78 drivers availables.
The same for Suburban cities, where we have 490 drivers to attend 625 rides. So as an advice, they should increase the number of drivers in Suburbar cities to better meet the demand.
However, for the Urban cities, the number of drivers is higher than the number of rides available, which means a lower Fare per Driver in average. So, the realocation of the number of drivers in Urban cities to Suburban or Rural cities would help increase the average driver's Fare.
